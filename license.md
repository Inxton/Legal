TYPES OF LICENSES 

The software comes with two types of licenses for two groups of users: 

Developer License - license is provided to developers, who wish to use INXTON Software for testing and/or development. This license is provided free of charge for an unlimited time and is subject to the limited warranty and limitations of liabilities contained herein. Software under Developer Licence might have some limitations in contrast to the Paid Licence. Please refer to INXTON website for further details: www.inxton.com/pricing.  

Software under Developer Licence might have some limitations in contrast to the Paid Licence. Please refer to INXTON website for further details: www.inxton.com/pricing. Development within this paragraph means the use of INXTON Software for the purpose of testing and programming with the intention to deploy the program(s) developed using INXTON Software in third party system and/or systems, which consist either of software and/or hardware (“System”). It is an obligation of the developer to secure a Paid License for each and every Instance of INXTON Software deployed on System. It is also an obligation of developer to ensure that these License Terms are provided to any third party for which Paid License is secured. For the avoidance of doubt, Developer License must never be used for the purpose of full Deployment of program(s) developed using INXTON Software on any System. For the purpose of these License terms Deployment means any placement of INXTON Software on System including first installation and further changes (“Deployment”). Developer License can be used exclusively for the purpose of developing program(s) that can be deployed, but not for the actual Deployment of those programs. Under Developer License, maximum Deployment Runtime for System running an Instance of INXTON Software is limited to two (2) hours (“Deployment Runtime”). If in doubt, please contact MTS at: hello@inxton.com 

Paid License - license that must be purchased by/for users whose System runs an Instance of INXTON Software for longer than Deployment Runtime, as defined in previous paragraph. License is provided for a fee and for term/s specified in the price list available at www.inxton.com/pricing. This license is subject to the limited warranty and limitations of liabilities contained herein. If you possess a Paid License, your rights to use the Instance of INXTON Software is limited to the System the fingerprint of which is bundled with the Paid License. In case you have subscription-based licence, you may have the option to extend your subscription by purchasing other Paid Licenses for other System(s). See the INXTON Software activation screens or other accompanying materials for subscription details. After the expiration of your subscription, most features of the INXTON Software will stop running. 

WHEN A PAID LICENSE IS PURCHASED, IT IS BUNDLED WITH A FINGERPRINT OF A PARTICULAR SYSTEM SUBMITTED BY DEVELOPER / FUTURE OWNER OF THE PAID LICENSE. IT IS ONLY THIS SPECIFIC SYSTEM WITH THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION AND SERIAL NUMBER, WHERE A PROGRAM DEVELOPED USING INXTON SOFTWARE CAN BE DEPLOYED. 

 

SOFTWARE VERSIONS 

The software is/will be released in two main versions: 

Preview Version. Some or all of the INXTON Software may be licensed on as a Preview Version. Your rights to use Preview Version of software are governed by these License Terms and are limited. THE PREVIEW VERSION IS DESIGNED FOR TESTING ONLY AND ANY SOFTWARE DEVELOPED USING THE PREVIEW VERSION MUST NEVER BE DEPLOYED ON ANY SYSTEM FOR OTHER THAN TESTING PURPOSES. TO AVOID ANY DOUBT PREVIEW VERSION MUST NEVER BE DEPLOYED IN REAL PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. Once created, you may have the option to convert your Preview Version into Released Version of INXTON Software which may enable you to use the programs created using the preview version for other than testing purposes.  

Released Version - Some or all of the INXTON Software may be licensed as Released Version. Your rights to use Released Version are governed by these terms and conditions. THE RELEASED VERSION IS DESIGNED FOR DEVELOPING PROGRAMS DESIGNATED FOR TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT ON SYSTEM(S) IN PRODUCTION. 

 

RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPER 

INXTON Software is only a software tool that enables development of program(s) that can be deployed for testing and/or operation of System. INXTON Software is safe and suitable for testing and/or Deployment on any System. Program(s) developed using INXTON Software is the sole responsibility of developer who made it and or contributed to its making.

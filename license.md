Article III.
Types of Licence

3.1 INXTON Software comes in two types of licence: 

Developer Licence 
Paid Licence 
3.2 The Developer Licence is provided to developers who wish to use INXTON Software for testing or development in order to decide whether INXTON Software suits their needs and whether they wish to upgrade to a Paid Licence. This licence is provided free of charge for an unlimited period. INXTON Software provided under Developer Licence might have certain limitations in contrast to the Paid Licence. The Licensee may use unlimited number of Instances of INXTON Software with the Developer Licence.  

3.3 For the purpose of this Agreement, “development” shall mean any placement of INXTON Software for the purpose of the first installation and further changes using INXTON Software in a third party system or systems, which consist either of software or hardware (the “Target System”). Except for a limited period of testing, for the purposes of permanent use, the developer shall be obliged to secure a Paid Licence for each and every Instance of INXTON Software deployed on the Target System. To avoid any doubts, the Developer Licence must never be used for the purpose of full deployment (i.e. for full commercial use) of program(s) developed using INXTON Software on any Target System. The Developer Licence may be used exclusively for the purpose of developing trial programs that can be tested but not commercially exploited or deployed.  

3.4 The Paid Licence is a licence that must be purchased by/for users whose Target System runs an Instance of INXTON Software for any other than the limited testing period, as defined in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 hereof. The Paid Licence is provided for a fee and for term/s specified in the price list available at www.inxton.com/pricing. For the Licensees with a Paid Licence, the right to use every single Instance of INXTON Software shall be limited to the Target System and Devices, the fingerprint of which is bundled with the Paid Licence. The Licensee may install only one Instance of INXTON Software per Paid Licence. To avoid any doubts, for Target Systems consisting of more Devices requiring more Instances of INXTON Software, every single installation/Instance of INXTON Software requires a separate Paid Licence. 

3.5 When a Paid Licence is purchased, it is bundled with a fingerprint of a particular Device submitted by the developer/future owner of the Paid Licence, i.e. it is only this particular unique Device with the unique hardware and/or software configuration and serial number, where a program developed using INXTON Software may be deployed. Activation associates the use of INXTON Software with a fingerprint of the specific Device and Target System for each and every Paid Licence. During activation, INXTON Software automatically compares the submitted fingerprint of the Device and the Target System with the fingerprint submitted to the Licensor when purchasing the Paid Licence. Unless properly activated, INXTON Software used on a basis of Paid Licence will not operate properly. 

3.6 The Licensor’s licence and service fees are specified in the Licensor’s pricelist. 

Article IV.
INXTON Software Versions 

4.1 INXTON Software comes in two main versions:  

Preview Version 
Production Ready Version 
4.2 INXTON Software as such or part(s) thereof may be licensed as a Preview Version. The Preview Version is designed for testing only and any software developed using the Preview Version must never be deployed on any Target System for other than testing purposes. To avoid any doubts, the Preview Version must never be deployed commercially or in real production environment and its functionality may be limited. The Preview Version may be upgraded to the Production Ready Version of INXTON Software. Thus, the Preview Version is designed for developing programs designated for testing and developing on system(s) in production (the Developer Licence).  The Preview Version is not mature enough to be used in production environment, it may have features other than those included in the Production Ready Version and it is aimed for evaluation purposes only. To this end, the Licensor shall be entitled to collect real time data from operation of Preview Versions. Collecting of such data is subject to our Privacy Policy (visit: www.inxton.com/privacy-policy).

4.3 INXTON Software as such or part(s) thereof may be licensed as Production Ready Version. The Production Ready Version is designed for developing programs designated for both testing as well as full scale commercial deployment and application (the Paid Licence) in Target Systems.
